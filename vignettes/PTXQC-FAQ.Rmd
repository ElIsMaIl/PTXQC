# FAQ (Frequently asked questions) for PTXQC

## Installation
_______
### Question: Some error occurred during installation. What do I do? ###

**Answer:** One common error is that the CRAN mirror hosting the R packages is incomplete/buggy and installation of packages fails.
   This **could** look like this:
   ```
   Error in XXXX(file.path(pkgname, "DESCRIPTION"), c("Package", "Type")) : 
   cannot open the connection
   In addition: Warning messages:
   ...
   ```
   or
   ```
   Warning message:
   In download.file(url, destfile, method, mode = "wb", ...) :
   downloaded length 228962 != reported length 229751
   ```
   
   Try another CRAN mirror (type `chooseCRANmirror()`) and then re-run the failed command.
  
   If you're still stuck, please open a [ticket] [issuetracker] (see 'Bug Reporting' on the main PTXQC homepage for the details you should provide).
