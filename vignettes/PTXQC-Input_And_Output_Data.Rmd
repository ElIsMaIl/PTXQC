PTXQC generates quality control reports for [MaxQuant] results.

## Input

When a full report is generated, PTXQC requires the following **input files**:
  
  - parameters.txt
  - summary.txt
  - proteinGroups.txt
  - evidence.txt
  - msms.txt
  - msmsScans.txt

These files can be found in the `<baseDir>/combined/txt` folder after MaxQuant analysis successfully finished.
Here, `<baseDir>` is your main MaxQuant project folder containing your Raw files.

If you are not interested in the full report or only a subset of these files are available,
PTXQC can be configured to look only at some of them. See
```{r, eval=FALSE}
vignette("PTXQC-CustomizeReport", package = "PTXQC")
```
for details.

## Output

By default PTXQC will generate a report in **PDF** format.

We are currently adding support for a more interactive **HTML** report. To enable HTML output,
just set it in the YAML config file (see above for the vignette hint on report customization).
